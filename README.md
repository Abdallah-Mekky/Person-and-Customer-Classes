# Person-and-Customer-Classes
Design a class named Person with fields for holding a person’s name, address, and tele-phone number. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate mutator and accessor methods for the class’s fields.  Next, design a class named Customer, which extends the Person class. The Customer class should have a field for a customer number and a boolean field indicating whether the cus-tomer wishes to be on a mailing list. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate mutator and accessor methods for the class’s fields. Demonstrate an object of the Customer class in a simple program.
